# Segmentation-of-microscopic-images

In the field of processing microscopic images, the primary task is to minimize the error of cell segmentation, to further correctly determine the characteristics of each.
We proposed set of operations that allows **approximate** segmentation of those images by using Voronoi diagrams.
